Whenever you have to modify the time, attendees, or subject of an appointment, always send the updated one with comments at the top to explain why you want to make these changes.
 
Example:

[[greyBox]]
|  (adding Uly since he may want to know that we are working on TimePro this day)
|  




This will help to solidify the changes and alleviate confusion.
