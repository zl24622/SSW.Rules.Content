The  **
![]()** tag of HTML has 2 attributes that should not be used -  **"height"** and **"width"** .  Any image resizing should  be done via CSS. If the height / width ratio doesn't match that of original image, the image will be stretched.

[[badExample]]
| ![Stretched image caused by inline height/width ratio that doesn't match](streched-image.jpg)

[[goodExample]]
| ![Avoiding inline height/width ratio keeps the image as original](non-streched-image.jpg)
We have a program called     [SSW Code Auditor](http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/CodeAuditor/Rules.aspx#IMGWidth) to check for this rule.
