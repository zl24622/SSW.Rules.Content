Team Foundation Server Update 2 and Team Foundation Server 2013 comes with built in support for Git as a version control system.
 
![How you start using Git on TFS](git-screen.jpg)
You should use Git if you:

- Are running an open source project
- Have lots of remote team members (as you get offline repo access with full history)
- Have an unstable/sporadic internet connection
- Develop in a non Microsoft environment (e.g. Linux, OSX)


There are also several disadvantages:

- No "My Work" view in Team Explorer
- No "Code Review" integration in Visual Studio
- No "Check in Policies"
- No SOX, FDA or CFD-11 compliance


At this point, SSW still recommends Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC) as the version control system of choice.
