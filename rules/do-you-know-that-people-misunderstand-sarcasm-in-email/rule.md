From [Flame emails missing the mark](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Redirect/smh_flameemailsmissingthemark.htm) on the Sydney Morning Herald: "The senders of the [email] messages expected their partners to correctly interpret their tone nearly 80% of the time, but in fact, they only scored just over 50%... Those attempting to interpret the message believed they had scored 90% accuracy".

Because there is no "tone of voice" in an email, sarcasm can easily be misinterpreted by the receiver.

[[badExample | This is bad because it may seem like John is being reprimanded, even though the sender may just be giving him a "heads up" for next time]]
|       "John, make sure your office is clean when clients come in - you might scare them away with all that mess."
|

[[goodExample | When in doubt, use a smiley face at the end of the comment to soften it up a bit]]
|  "John, make sure your office is clean when clients come in - you might scare them away with all that mess :)"
