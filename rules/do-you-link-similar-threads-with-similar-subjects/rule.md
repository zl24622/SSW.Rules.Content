Often there are two email threads that have separate tasks in them, but that both relate to a very similar topic. In this case, it can be useful to give them the same subject, with a number afterwards to differentiate them.
 
Example:

[[greyBox]]
|  SSW Rules - Add 'please update this rule' button #1 

[[greyBox]]
|  SSW Rules - Add 'please update this rule' button #2
