Create a hashtag for your presentation prior to the presentation and display it your introduction slide! Twitter backchannels are valuable sources of feedback.<br> 
![A Twitter hashtag allows the attendees to have a backchannel that can be used to talk about your presentation, during your presentation](PPTwit.jpg)
![](PPTwit2.jpg)(optional) Midway through the presentation have a slide where you say "Let's see if any questions have arisen"
