This picture shows a flowchart of Campaigns and Quick Campaigns in CRM 2013:
 
![Campaign VS Quick Campaign flowchart.](CampaignVSQuickCampaign.jpg)
A Campaign can extend over a long period of time, with potentially multiple different media types being used for a common purpose. It has extensive meta-data to both plan activities and then show reports on results. e.g.

- A monthly newsletter
- A flyer campaign
- A cold-calling campaign


A Quick Campaign, however, is for a one-off distribution of emails to a targeted group of contacts. e.g.

- Letting your local clients know about an upcoming event by email
