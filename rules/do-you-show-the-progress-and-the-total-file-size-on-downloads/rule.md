When a user downloads a file from your site, they should see a progress bar along with                     the total size and estimated time, this way they will see the size of the download                     increasing and will knowing when it will finish.
 
[[badExample]]
| ![there is no indication of the total size of the download or<br>                        the percent complete, thus no estimate of how long left](bar-progress-bad.jpg)
[[goodExample]]
| ![percent complete, time left, total size and a progress bar<br>                        are all shown](bar-progress-good.jpg)
