Let's say you press “Send” and get a bounce, e.g. An email in your inbox that reads:

[[greyBox]]
|  
| Delivery has failed to these recipients or distribution lists:
| 
| Adam Cogan ([adam@northwind.com](mailto&#58;adam@northwind.com))
| The recipient's e-mail address was not found in the recipient's e-mail system. Microsoft Exchange will not try to redeliver this message for you. Please check the e-mail address and try resending this message, or provide the following diagnostic text to your system administrator.
|  
Get the correct email address and ‘Reply to all’ with just this text in brackets:

[[greyBox]]
|    (Resending with Adam’s correct email)
|

|   [Original Email]  Figure: Good Example - Correct the email address and send again.
