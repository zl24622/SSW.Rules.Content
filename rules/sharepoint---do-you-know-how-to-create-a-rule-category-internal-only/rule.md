Basically, creating a rule category contains two parts of work.

1. Create a "rule category" in Term Store (e.g. "Rules to Better xxx")
2. Create a "rule summary" page to show all the rule pages belong to this rule category.



 



 **1. Create a "rule category" in Term Store (e.g. "Rules to Better xxx")**   



> 1) Open browser, log in to [http://rules.ssw.com.au/admin/](/admin/)
> 
> 
> 2) Open [https://rules.ssw.com.au/\_layouts/15/termstoremanager.aspx?tsid=eacc332d045a40e1bcc10498d65b767f](/_layouts/15/termstoremanager.aspx?tsid=eacc332d045a40e1bcc10498d65b767f) , under "ImportTaxonomy" | "RuleCategories", find the right "parent category" (e.g. "Communication"), click "Create Term":

**2.** **Create a "rule summary" page to show rule pages belong to this rule category**

> 4) "Check in" and "Publish" this "Rule Summary" page, then you should have a page like below,
![Any futher created "rule pages" belong to this "rule category" will be listed on this page](rulecategor6.jpg)
