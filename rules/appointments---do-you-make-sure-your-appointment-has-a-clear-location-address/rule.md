Make sure appointments have address details unless it's obvious for all attendees.

[[goodExample]]

If you are meeting at SSW Sydney, it is important to book the Chapel or another meeting room. You can do this by adding the room name to the Location field. If it is the SSW Chapel, it will then appear in the Chapel Bookings calendar and alert all necessary parties that you will be using the space.

It's important to always add the address information in appointments when a third party is included. i.e.:

- A client meeting at your location
- A meeting at the client location


The exception is for internal meeting appointments:

I would invite Zune to work Saturday @ SSW (but not include the address)
