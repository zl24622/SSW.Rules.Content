Having a good folder structure in version control allows everyone to know where everything is without even having to look.
 

```
/northwind
 /trunk
 /branches (or shelvesets)
  /experiemental-feature1
 /releases (or tags)
  /1.0.0.356
```

Figure: Bad example, SVN conventions are a dated and ignore releases, hotfixes and Service Packs 
Trunk is the old way, Main is the new way as per the branching guidance, and it is the way that Microsoft does things.
