Always introduce yourself \*after\* you have asked the audience who they are. Don't be shy, tell them:

- Who are you? (optional - include something personal)
- What you do (your service or product)?
- What makes you qualified to speak on this topic?


![Talk about yourself after you know the audience a little. It is not great to bring up the 'About' slide too early](aboutAdam.gif)
