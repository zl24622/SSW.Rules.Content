If you are recording a choice you should create a rule, if you are explaining how you did something, it should be a blog post.

If you are writing a really long email, ask yourself if it would be better as a lining blog post rather than a one off email.

**Hint:** If you are really good you will end up with one or more rules, a blog post and a link in your email
