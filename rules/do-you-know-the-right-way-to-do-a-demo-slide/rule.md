By placing a little visual cue on your slide, you can remind yourself to show a demo to the audience. Avoid displaying the word 'demo', because when out of time, presenters skip them and leave the audience felling ripped off. <br> 
The icon allows you to skip it when running short on time, without upsetting the audience.
